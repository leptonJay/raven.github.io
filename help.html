        <h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
        <p>During the installation/setup, when the app is first, Raven requires the settings below to start functioning;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>User-Information</h4>
            <p>Raven requires your <b>name,contact, email, </b>and <b>gender.</b> </p>
            <p>Raven uses the name, especially your <b>first name</b> to refer to you incase it needs to call you. The
              email is needed incase the developer
              needs to send you some information about new updates and security patches. The contact is also required
              for the same purporse. Dont
              worry, we are not so disturbing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Device Administrator</h4>
            <p>Activating Raven as an Administrator gives it full capability to operate. According to Android rules,
              there are some actions an app
              is not allowed to perfom is its not a device administrator, such as sending your phone to
              <b>sleep</b>(<em>locking your phone when required</em>)or setting up a screen lock.
            </p>
            <p>In case you did not enable Raven as an administrator on first time run, you can go to your <i>phone
                settings - security - administrators</i> and then activate it.</p>
            <p>For full operation of Raven, I recommend that you enable Raven as an administrator.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Permissions</h4>
            <p>if you are running Android version 6 and above on your device, Raven will ask for a number of permissions
              during its setup.
              These permissions allow Raven to access your <b>storage, phone, contacts, sms, location, internet</b> and
              others.</p>
            <p>Accessing storage allows the app to read files like music, documents, videos and others. Accessing the
              contacts allows the app get
              the list of contacts and call the person you want. With these permissions, Raven is able to write and send
              for you messages,
              Well...you can easily know what the other permissions are used for.</p>
            <p><strong>Other vital permissions</strong> that you need to grant the app in settings are<b> Modify system
                settings</b>, which allows Raven to help you change your settings like toggling wi-fi and bluetooth and
              <b>Draw over other apps</b> which allows the floating feature to display when other apps are running.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 id="microphone">Microphone</h3>
        <p>Although the app has many purposes, controlling your device using just your voice happens to be the main
          purpose. There fore knowing
          how to activate the microphone is very important.</p>
        <p>Simply <em><strong>tap the microphone only once</strong></em> on the bottom right corner of Raven's main
          screen to activate the microphone. The app will start to listen as it processes and writes down what you are
          saying. </p>
        <p>When finished, <strong>wait for the app to respond</strong>. Wait until its is done speaking and then you can
          tap the mic and say your next command.</p>
        <p>However if <strong>Automatic listening</strong> is enabled in the settings, then there is no need to tap the
          microphone again because the app will <strong>listen again automatically.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 id="musicplayer">Music Player</h3>
        <p>The music player can be accessed by swiping right, voice command or tapping music button on Raven's home
          screen.
          It is designed in user friendly way and any one can use it. It can also be controlled by voice commands to
          change the songs, pause, play and repeat and others..</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 id="speech">Speech Training</h3>
        <p>This feature <strong>allows you to train Raven new words and put responses and actions on them</strong>.
          Simply tap the setting to open the speech training screen and
          tap the microphone button to start the microphone.</p>
        <p>Say something new and then assign your custom responses and add an action if you want. </p>
        <p>You can add a number of responses on a single command and then Raven will randomly select which one to say at
          the time she wants at a given time.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 id="pc_connection">Connecting to PC</h3>
        <p>Raven has the ablity to link your phone to your computer or even your friends phone. The connection allows
          you to share <em>music, apps, images, documents, videos</em> and <em> files</em> between the linked devices.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Tap on the pc connection button from Raven's home screen to start the connection. If your Wi-Fi or
              Hotspot is off, the app willl pop a dialog box for you to turn on either Wi-Fi or Hotspot.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>After that, the app will generate an <strong>Ip Address </strong>that you will use after words. Click
              <strong>yes</strong>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Connected your computer or other device you want on the same Wi-fi as your device or connect to the
              <strong>RAVEN-HOTSPOT</strong> created by the app.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>Open any browser on your computer or other device and type the Ip address given to you earlier, in the
            link search area.</li>
          <li>Raven will pop up on the other device wait for verification from the source of connection.</li>
          <li>When the dialog appears notifying you of an incoming connection, click <strong>yes. </strong>Then click
            the <strong>Start Button</strong> on that will appear on the browser.</li>
          <li>You are now good to go.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
        <p>Swipe right or tap the settings button on Ravens Home Screen to access the settings. Some of the settings are
          explained below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Floating Head</h4>
            <p>This creates a draggable widget on top of your screen. This widget will run even on top of other apps. It
              provides some short cuts to the
              app while you are using other apps.</p>
            <p>activating this feature my require the <b>Draw Over Other Apps</b> permission in the app's settings.
              Don't forget to grant it or else
              the feature will not work.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Keep Screen On</h4>
            <p>This feature allows the app to keep the screen on as long as you are using the app....<strong>remember
                this only works when Raven is on the
                screen.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4 id="back_call">Background-call Detection</h4>
            <p>This feature is still a working progress. It is intended to allow a user to call the app with a specific
              word or clap even when the screen is off.</p>
            <p>This is really helpfull when you misplaced your phone as<strong> it will trigger an alarm at maximum
                volume incase you call it three times without issuing any other command.</strong> Its an easy way locate
              your phone when covered in clothes or misplaced in your bedroom.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Automatic Listening</h4>
            <p>This allows the app to automatically listen again after it has said something. When no command is issued.
              The feature will be temporarily disabled until the
              user taps the microphone button again.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Sreen lock</h4>
            <p>This is also still a working progress. However it is intended to strengthen your security.</p>
          </li>
